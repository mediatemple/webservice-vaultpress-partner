=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document outlines the methods available through the
WebService::VaultPress::Partner::Request::Usage class.  You should not instantiate
an object of this class yourself when using WebService::VaultPress::Partner,
it is created by the arguments to ->GetUsage.   Its primary purpose is to use
Moose's type and error systems to throw errors when required
parameters are not passed.

WebService::VaultPress::Partner is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple and 
consistent Client API to the VaultPress Partner API.  The main focus of 
the library is to provide classes and functions that allow you to quickly 
access VaultPress from Perl applications.

The modules consist of the WebService::VaultPress::Partner module itself as well as a 
handful of WebService::VaultPress::Partner::Request modules as well as a response object,
WebService::VaultPress::Partner::Response, that provides consistent error and success 
methods.
